# Test and Fix the Connector

## Goal
Validate the generated connector for **{{source_name}}** by executing the provided test suite, diagnosing failures, and applying minimal, targeted fixes until all tests pass.

## Instructions

1. Create a `test_{source_name}_lakeflow_connect.py` under `tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/` directory.
2. Use `tests/unit/sources/test_suite.py` to run test and follow `tests/unit/sources/example/test_example_lakeflow_connect.py` or other sources as an example.
3. Use the configuration file `tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/configs/dev_config.json` and `tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/configs/dev_table_config.json` to initialize your tests.
   - example:
```json
{
  "user": "YOUR_USER_NAME",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
}
```
   - If `dev_config.json` does not exist, create it and ask the developers to provide the required parameters to connect to a test instance of the source.
   - If needed, create `dev_table_config.json` and ask developers to supply the necessary table_options parameters for testing different cases.
   - **Batch size limit for incremental tables (do this automatically):** For any table that supports incremental reading (CDC/append), you **must** inspect the connector implementation to find the option that controls per-microbatch record or page limit (e.g. `max_records_per_batch`, `limit`) and automatically add it to `dev_table_config.json` with a small value (less than 5). Do **not** wait for the user to provide this — read the connector source code, identify the relevant option name, and configure it yourself. This maps to `table_options` at runtime and ensures tests sample only a few records and return quickly instead of reading the entire dataset.
   - Be sure to remove these config files after testing is complete and before committing any changes.
4. Run the tests using the project virtual environment (Python 3.10+ required):
```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/test_{source_name}_lakeflow_connect.py -v
```
5. Based on test failures, update the implementation under `src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{source_name}` as needed. Use both the test results and the source API documentation, as well as any relevant libraries and test code, to guide your corrections.

## Debugging Hangs and Slow Tests

Tests that hang (no output, no error) are almost always an API call that never returns. Systematic approach:

1. **Enable debug logging** to see where it stalls:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/test_{source_name}_lakeflow_connect.py -v -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG
```
If `urllib3` logs `Starting new HTTPS connection` with no response line, the HTTP call itself is hanging.

2. **Isolate the HTTP call** — reproduce the exact request (same URL, headers, params) in a standalone script. If that also hangs, the problem is the query parameters, not the connector logic.

3. **Narrow down by elimination** — remove or change one query parameter at a time. Common culprits: unbounded history scans (`date_range=all`), ascending sort on large datasets, missing date-range filters.

4. **Start with the most constrained query** — small `limit`, narrow time window, status filters. Once it works, progressively relax to find the boundary.

5. **Check for missing timeouts** — every `requests.get()`/`session.get()` must have a `timeout` parameter. Without it, a slow API hangs forever with no error. For testing, set a short timeout (e.g., 10 seconds) so failed requests surface quickly instead of blocking for minutes.

6. **Suspect large-account behavior** — test credentials may connect to an account with millions of records. If queries time out, add server-side date filtering or switch to the sliding time-window pattern (see implement-connector SKILL).

## Notes

- This step is more interactive. Based on testing results, we need to make various adjustments.
- Remove the `dev_config.json` after this step.
- Avoid mocking data in tests. Config files will be supplied to enable connections to an actual instance.

## Git Commit on Completion

After all tests pass, commit any changes to the connector implementation and test files before returning
Only commit files that were actually modified or created. Use the exact source name in the commit message. Do not push — only commit locally.
